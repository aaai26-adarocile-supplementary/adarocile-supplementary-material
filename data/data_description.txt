Sample Dataset Description
==========================

File: sample_dataset.csv

This is a synthetic dataset created for testing and demonstration purposes.

Dataset Characteristics:
- Number of samples: 10
- Number of features: 4 (feature1, feature2, feature3, feature4)
- Target variable: binary classification (0 or 1)
- Task type: Classification

Feature Description:
- feature1: Continuous feature with values between 0.1 and 0.9
- feature2: Continuous feature with values between 0.1 and 0.9
- feature3: Continuous feature with values between 0.2 and 1.0
- feature4: Continuous feature with values between 0.1 and 1.0

Target Description:
- 0: Negative class
- 1: Positive class
- Balanced dataset with 5 samples per class

Usage:
This dataset can be used to test the Rocile and AdaRocile models
for binary classification tasks. The features are designed to be
reasonably separable for demonstration purposes.

Note: This is a small synthetic dataset intended for testing only.
For real applications, use larger, more representative datasets.
